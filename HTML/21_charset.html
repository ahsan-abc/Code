<!--
The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set, 
which covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world!

To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know the character set used in the page.
This is specified in the <meta> tag:


-->


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Entites</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
