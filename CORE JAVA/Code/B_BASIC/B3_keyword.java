Q. Keyword

->keyword in java are reserved word that have specific meaning and purpose within the java programing language.
->we cannot use any keyword as identifiers in java program.
->now java have 50 keywords




abstract	continue	for  	     new	    switch
assert 	    default	    goto*	     package	synchronized
boolean 	do	        if	         private	this
break	    double	    implements	 protected	throw
byte	    else	    import	     public	    throws
case	    enum      	instanceof	 return	    transient
catch	    extends	    int	         short	    try
char	    final	    interface	 static	    void
class	    finally	    long	     strictfp	volatile
const*	    float	    native       super      while

-> keyword  const and goto currently doesn't use.
-> true false and null might seems like keyword , but they are actually lirerals , we cannot use ad identifiers in java.

-> below some example to  use of keyword

public class B3_keyword{
	
	public static void main (String [] args)
	{
		int var = 90;                         //here i used  keyword int for declare a variable , the compiler know meaning and purpose of int.   
		System.out.println("var= "+var);
	}
